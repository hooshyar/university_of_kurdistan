# University_Of_Kurdistan

### This is not the official app.
  Some Students of UKH asked for flutter tutorials in Kurdish, we at [DATACODE.APP](https://www.datacode.app) respect UKH and their great effort to develop Kurdistan, so we decided to create a simple app and create tutorial at the same time.
